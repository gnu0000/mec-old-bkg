BKG   Windows background fader
==============================

  This program is for Windows users who have limited memory and/or
think faded colors look nice as a background.  This program will 
display a color fade as your Windows background.  A color fade means 
that the color gradually changes from one side to another in a smooth
fashion.  This App. has the advantage over wallpaper of needing very 
little memory.

  Once you run the program, the starting/ending colors and the fade
direction can be set from a dialog box.  The dialog box is brought
up by clicking on the background with the RIGHT mouse button. Setting
RGB values for the colors is done with scroll bars and/or mini edit boxes.
The fade style (Vertical, Horizontal, Vertical Center, Horizontal center)
is set via a combo box. The dialog box also has options to save the color
or exit the program.

  Before running BKG, make sure you set your wallpaper to NONE.  If you 
don't everything will work OK but the wallpaper will still be taking up 
whatever memory it needs for the bitmap.

  If you use other programs which are invoked by clicking the right mouse
button on the background (BackMenu for example), you can disable the mouse
for this program by adding the line UseMouse=No to the [BKG] section of 
your Win.Ini file. Note that if you do this you will need to edit Win.Ini
to change colors in the future as you will have no way of getting to the 
dialog box.

  Feel free to copy, distribute, fold, spindle and mutilate this program
as you like, BUT... I hereby claim no responsibility whatsoever for any
reason for anything... ever. Go GATORS!
