                 Faded Background for windows

      This program will display a color fade in your windows background.
   It has the advantage over wallpaper of needing almost no memory.

      To use this program you must have the wallpaper set to (NONE).
   There are 8 command line options you can specify to control the
   fade of the background, all are optional. They are:

               -V ... Specify vertical fade (default)
               -H ... Specify horizontal fade
               -r ... starting red value
               -g ... starting green value
               -b ... starting blue value
               -R ... ending red value
               -G ... ending green value
               -B ... ending blue value

      The starting color refers to the color at the top of the window 
   (or left in the case of horizontal fades). Ending color is the final
   color at the bottom (or right). This app may be terminated by the
   task manager.
